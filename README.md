# Swift Testing: a wildcard helper for testing invariants

This is an experimental tool for writing exhaustive Testing methods.

The idea is to make Testing tests easier to write, and easier to read.

## Example

asfas


## Ideas

* truth table outputter that makes a string with table containing all input variants and the result (it would be given some func to get that result)

## ResultTypes

Hasn't been made into invariant thing because it's immutable and currently this whole thing works via mutability.
Workaround: use the provided MutableResultType and then call .result on it in the test to get the actual ResultType.

    //    @Test
    //    func resultTypes() {
    //        typealias MyResult = Result<Bool, SomeError>
    //        // Results aren't mutable! Guess we could built something to instantiate it, but... meh
    //        let base = MyResult.success(true)
    //    }



### scratch

```
// thoughts:
//
// * one potential issue is that we mutate the prototype, so you need a mutable object.
//   but the code you're testing might well take an immutable type.
//
//   But this tool is meant for driving Testing test cases, where you will
//   probably construct the real type from it; so I think this mutable aspect is ok.
```
